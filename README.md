Collection of dot files to set up my working environment in vshell system

## To set up command line preferences
1. Create/go to your work directory
2. Clone this repository into your work directory
3. Ensure `.zprofile` doesn't exist in your home folder `~/`
4. Run `./link_dot_zshell.zsh`

This will create a soft link to your home folder with this repository's `.zprofile` file
#### if you ever going to edit your `.zprofile` make sure you edit the one in this repository and not the soft link in your home folder
